# This is one of my first python projects

## Description
This code is made to read from serial port, you proceed with mouse click.
If you don't have arduino sending you data, you can just click without putting anything in for serial port. Everything can be skipped.
Sorry for funky code, I was only beginning when I wrote this.

### Installation
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
```sh
python3 -B main.py
```
